Title: R package for Multi-state Reliability Demonstration Test Design
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Suiyao Chen
Maintainer: Suiyao Chen <suiyaochen@mail.usf.edu>
Description: This is a implementation of design methods for multi-state reliability demonstration tests (MSRDT) with failure count data, 
    which is associated with the work from the published paper "Multi-state Reliability Demonstration Tests" by Suiyao Chen et al. on Quality Engineering.
    It implements two types of MSRDT, multiple periods (MP) and multiple failure modes (MFM). 
    For MP, two different scenarios with criteria on cumulative periods (Cum) or separate periods (Sep) are implemented respectively.
    It also provides the implementation of conventional design method, namely binomial tests for failure count data.
