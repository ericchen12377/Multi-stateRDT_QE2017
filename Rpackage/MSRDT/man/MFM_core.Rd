\title{Probability Core for Multi-State RDT with Multiple Failure Modes}
\usage{
MFM_core(n, cvec, pivec)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{RDT sample size}

\item{cvec}{Maximum allowable failures for each separate period}

\item{pivec}{Failure probability for each seperate period}
}
\value{
Core probability of passing the test given specific failure probabilities
}
\description{
Define the summed core function inside of the integration which gets the probability of passing the test given specific failure probabilities
under different failure modes (for Multi-state RDT, Multiple Failure Modes).
}
\examples{
#Example for two failure modes
pi1 <- pi_MCSim_beta(M = 5000, seed = 10, a = 1, b = 1)
pi2 <- pi_MCSim_beta(M = 5000, seed = 10, a = 2, b = 18)
MFM_core(n = 10, cvec = c(1, 1), pivec = c(pi1[1], pi2[1]));
#The function also works for more than two failure modes,
however, may increase the computation cost.
MFM_core(n = 10, cvec = c(1, 1, 1), pivec = c(0.8, 0.9, 0.8));
